Welcome to my blog! I don't have a ton to say here other than this is my first post. I've done blogging before here and there with wordpress, blogger, etc. but I don't feel any of those old posts are relevant to my career anymore. So... goodbye old and hello new!

I'm using [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). Hexo is a static file generator, not a traditional blogging platform. I can create a new blog post via command line like-a-so:

``` bash
$ hexo new "My New Post"
```

Then I can deploy this to Heroku or GitHub and voila!

I'll be blogging about life, work, all things javascript, etc. so check back!
